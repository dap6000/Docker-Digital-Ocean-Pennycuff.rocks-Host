		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I am an energetic student. I try to have fun doing my projects. Iâ€™m also creative in my projects. In my periodic table project I made a game. I love to play with friends. I also love video games and soccer. I have learned a lot in SOAR and have had a fun time playing and doing projects with my friends.</p>
		<p>An obstacle I found was adjusting to project work. Another problem I had was asking for help. That is still one of my problems. It wasn't too hard to adjust because I was homeschooled for a long time. So it wasn't way too different. Health is also a problem for me. The reason for this is because I'm missing so many days and on a lot of medication.</p>
		<p>Some advice I would have for younger students:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Ask for help on projects</li>
			<li>Make friends fast</li>
			<li>Do group projects</li>
			<li>Talk to your partner a lot</li>
			<li>Try new things that you think will be fun</li>
		</ol>
